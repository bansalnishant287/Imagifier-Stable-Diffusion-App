# Imagifier Python App
## ML Text to Image App with Stable Diffusion
##  Stable Diffusion is an open source SOTA model for text to image generation from Stability AI. Used the Stable Diff model through Hugging Face Diffusers and build up an app using Tkinter so that we can use it on our desktop with nothing more than a "4GB GPU".
### To run this app to your local system:
#### Step 1 : Install all the dependencies from 'requirements.txt'.
#### Step 2 : Generate authorization token from hugging face and paste it in 'authtoken.py'.
#### Step 3 : Run 'app.py'.
